INTRODUCTION                                *brunch*

Inspired by vim-rails this plugin makes navigating through your brunch projects
a lot more comfortable. Besides an interface to the brunch command line it
offers Ex commands to quickly move from one brunch file to one of its related
files.

Editing your model and want to have the corresponding unit test in a vertical
split? Just go :BVtest.

COMMANDS                                    *brunch-commands*

Vim-brunch expects that you start Vim inside the root folder of your brunch
project. When a brunch project has been detected the following commands are
available:

:Bmodel [name]      Opens the model for the current module or opens the model
                    with the optionally given name.

:Bview [name]       Opens the view for the current module.

:Bcontroller [name] Opens the controller for the current module.

:Btemplate [name]   Opens the template for the current module.

:Bstyle [name]      Opens the stylesheet for the current module.

:Btest              Opens the test for the current file. Inside a model this
                    will open the unit test for a model, inside a view it opens
                    the view_test etc.  Inside a template, for example, this
                    command doesn't make much sense.

:Bconfig            Opens the config file for the project.

:Bindex             Opens index.html in app/assets/index.html.

:Build [options]    Builds the project. Same as brunch build.

:Bgenerate <type> <name> [options] 
                    Generate files from template. Same as brunch generate.

:Bdestroy <type> <name> [options]
                    Destroys changes made by :Bgenerate. Same as brunch destroy.

:Btests [options]   Runs all tests for the current project. Same as brunch test.
                    Requires brunch 1.3+.

CONFIGURATION                                   *brunch-configuration*

For now the plugin does not detect which brunch skeleton you are using, so by
default it expects the standard directory structure and CoffeeScript,
Handlebars, Stylus. If you want to change those settings, the following global
variables are defined:

>
        let g:brunch_path_app='app'
The directory of the app folder.

>
         g:brunch_path_test='test'
The directory of the test folder.

>
         g:brunch_ext_script='coffee'
The extension for script files.

>
        g:brunch_ext_stylesheet='styl'
The extension for stylesheets.

>
        g:brunch_ext_template='hbs'
The extension for templates.

>
        g:brunch_name_delim='_'
The delimiter in file names, _ or -.
